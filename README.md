## PR Panel

A homebrew project to retrieve pull request information from one or more GitHub repos, and reformat into a simple dashboard-style overview in HTML.

This is written with a Raspberry Pi Zero W plus small colour screen in mind, with the intention for it to sit underneath the main monitor and give an at-a-glance overview of the CI status checks for all active pull requests in a set of target repositories.
